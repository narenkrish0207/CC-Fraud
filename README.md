# My Analysis
Today, I was looking at a credit card fraud dataset, and I noticed that it has 31 columns in total. The first column is about time, which basically indicates when the transaction started, and it keeps track of the time in seconds over a span of two days. Then, there are 28 other columns that have been encrypted, so we can’t really tell what they represent—it could be a person’s name, a bank’s name, or anything like that. There’s also another column that indicates the amount, and this amount is given in euros, since it’s from a European country. Finally, there’s a column that tells us whether the transaction was fraudulent or not. From all of this, I understood that this dataset is used for supervised learning, and more specifically, it falls under the category of classification.
